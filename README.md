# Counter | FYI

This is an experiment in microfrontends, built to compare the developer experience (DX) in a selection of frameworks: `React`, `Svelte`, `Vue`, and `Imba`. The build process

If you want to build the project yourself. You can clone this project and run `npm start` in the root folder to initiate the build process. DO NOTE that this requires Docker. You can alternately build each podlet manually, and run `node index.js` in each podlet, and then run `node server.js`. Finally, you can pull all the containers from the Docker repository: `docker pull amediocredev/counter-fyi`.

> The website linked to this repo is a demo and is not running Podium (only the output of each podlet).
